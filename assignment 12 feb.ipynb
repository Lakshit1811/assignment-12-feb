    "An exception in Python is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. It indicates an error or exceptional condition that requires special handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of exceptions in Python include division by zero, accessing an index that is out of bounds, trying to open a file that doesn't exist, and others. When an exception is raised, the normal flow of the program is interrupted, and the program tries to find an exception handler to handle the exception. If no appropriate exception handler is found, the program terminates and produces an error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that syntax errors are detected when a program is compiled or interpreted, whereas exceptions are raised at runtime. Syntax errors occur when the Python code doesn't conform to the rules of the language, and they prevent the program from being executed at all. Exceptions, on the other hand, occur while the program is executing and can be handled by the code itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, syntax errors are errors in the syntax of the code, while exceptions are run-time errors that occur when a condition that was not expected by the programmer occurs."
